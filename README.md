# Data-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data

The dataset that will be wrangled , analyzed and visualized is the tweet archive of
WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a twitter account that people rate their dogs.
wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and
visualizations

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets,
but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text,
which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper,
and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered
for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356)

# Purpose of this analysis 
The purpose is to create analyses and visualizations as it is very basic information from twitter ,that need gathering, then assessing and cleaning .
